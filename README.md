# AI-Based Text-to-Image Generator 🧠🎨

This project is part of my IBM Final Project where I built an AI-powered model that generates images from text prompts using diffusion models. It showcases the power of Generative AI to create visuals from natural language input.

## 🛠 How to Run the Project

1. Open the .ipynb notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Run all cells sequentially  
3. Enter a custom text prompt  
4. Wait for the model to generate an image  
5. View/save your AI-generated image
